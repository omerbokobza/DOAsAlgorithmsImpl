# DOAs Algorithms Implemenation
Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation is a critical component
in various fields, such as radar, sonar, wireless communications, and acoustic source localization. 
This comprehensive review paper provides an analysis of diverse DOA estimation techniques, ranging from classical methods like MUSIC, LS, MVDR, and ESPRIT to cutting-edge approaches involving deep learning. We delve into the underlying principles,
strengths, and limitations of each method and discuss their applications in real-world scenarios.

This code contain the numpy implementation for DOA algorithms.
